# Jetcake API
This is a demonstration API for a simple community discussion feature.

# Test Cases
There are a series of test cases written using Django's built in unit testing features.
Fixture data for the test cases can be found in the jetcake/fixtures directory and includes a default user and a small selection of test messages.

To run the test cases use Django's manage.py script.

    python manage.py test
